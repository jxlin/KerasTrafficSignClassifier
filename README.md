# KerasTrafficSignClassifier
This is a fun non-MNIST example of using Keras for image classification. 

In a few lines of code we develop a model for classifying traffic signs. 
The data set used is from the 2011 German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Competition, 
see <a href="http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news">GTSRB</a>. 
It's too big to be saved on github, but publicly available. The model we build reaches 
a test accuracy of 97.98% without hyper parameter tuning.
